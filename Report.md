# Password Strength Evaluation Report

## Objective

To analyze the strength of different passwords using online tools and understand how various components contribute to password security.

## Password Testing Summary

| Password           | Score | Complexity  | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| sunshine123        | 44%   | Good        | Lacks uppercase letters and symbols                   |
| Summer@2025        | 100%  | Very Strong | Good length and includes upper, lower, number, symbol |
| T!mE4$Action!      | 100%  | Very Strong | Complex and diverse characters                        |
| mY_L1ttl3#S3cr3t!  | 100%  | Very Strong | Good length and creative leetspeak                    |
| Z#9!dQ\*7^bRp@2$Lw | 100%  | Very Strong | Randomized, long, highly secure                       |

## Key Observations

- Passwords with mixed character types score higher.
- Leetspeak (e.g. using `3` instead of `e`) increases complexity.
- Random symbols and increased length significantly enhance strength.

## Screenshots

Screenshots of each password test are attached in the submission:

## Learnings

- **Longer passwords** are harder to crack via brute-force.
- Use at least one **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **number**, and **symbol**.
- Avoid common words, names, and patterns.
- **Avoid repetition** or predictable substitutions only (like `@` for `a`).
